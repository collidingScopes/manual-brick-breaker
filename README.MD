<p>Play brick breaker the way our ancestors wanted us to -- with our hands!</p>
<p>‚úã Move your hand left/right, keeping your palm in front of your camera</p>
<p>üß± Break all the bricks to advance to the next level</p>
<p>üéöÔ∏è Each level increases ball speed by 10% and reduces paddle width by 10%</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your webcam is enabled and your palm is visible</p>
<p>All processing is done in real-time within your browser. This project is built using javascript, html canvas, and mediapipe hand tracking.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this and are feeling generous, feel free to buy me a coffee. I will continue to build free and open source projects, and this would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!</p>
